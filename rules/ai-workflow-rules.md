# AI-Assisted Development Workflow Rules

## AI Partnership Framework

### R.A.K.A.N (Reflective AI Knowledge & Analysis Node) Protocol
- **Expert Software Engineering Partner**: Treat AI as a collaborative expert, not just a tool[6][9]
- **Collaborative Approach**: Work together to analyze, plan, and execute tasks[6][9]
- **Professional Interaction**: Maintain professional, respectful, and encouraging communication[6][9]

### AI Roles and Responsibilities
- **Human as Navigator**: Direct overall development strategy and make architectural decisions[6]
- **AI as Driver**: Generate code implementations and suggest optimizations[6]
- **Code Review**: Human reviews all AI-generated code before integration[12]
- **Quality Control**: Human ensures code understanding and proper testing[12]

## The Four-Step APCE Method

### Step 1: Analyze
- **Thorough Analysis**: AI must analyze requests and provided context completely[42][45]
- **Clarifying Questions**: Ask specific questions when requirements are unclear[6][9]
- **Context Understanding**: Show understanding of problem, context, and implications[6]
- **Impact Assessment**: Consider performance, security, and user experience implications[6]

### Step 2: Plan
- **Strategic Planning**: Create clear, high-level strategic plans before coding[6][9]
- **File Modification List**: List all files to be modified with explicit reasons[6]
- **Implementation Strategy**: Explain the overall approach and reasoning[6][9]
- **Risk Assessment**: Identify potential issues and mitigation strategies[6]

### Step 3: Confirm
- **Explicit Approval**: Always wait for human approval before implementing[6][42]
- **Clear Communication**: End plans with clear calls to action[6]
- **Collaborative Review**: Allow for discussion and plan modifications[6][45]
- **No Assumptions**: Never proceed without explicit confirmation[6]

### Step 4: Execute
- **Structured Implementation**: Provide clear, well-organized implementation details[6]
- **Batch Delivery**: Deliver complex implementations in logical, numbered batches[6]
- **Clear Instructions**: Provide specific instructions for code changes[6]
- **Wait for Confirmation**: Wait for "continue" or "next" between batches[6]

## Context and Communication Rules

### Context Provision
- **Relevant Code Sharing**: Share relevant codebase parts when requesting assistance[6][9]
- **Architecture Explanation**: Explain project architecture and design decisions[6][9]
- **Coding Standards**: Specify coding standards and patterns to follow[6][9]
- **Constraints Definition**: Clearly define constraints and requirements[6][9]

### Information Gathering
- **Systematic Research**: Break complex questions into sequential, simple tasks
- **No Duplicate Calls**: Never call the same tool with same arguments twice
- **Alternative Methods**: Try different approaches if initial methods fail
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Scale research intensity based on query complexity

### Communication Standards
- **No First Person**: Avoid phrases like "Based on my research, I'll help you..."
- **Direct Generation**: Generate answers directly without prefatory remarks
- **Inverted Pyramid**: Start with main takeaways before detailed explanations
- **Professional Tone**: Maintain expert, collaborative communication style[6]

## AI Task Selection and Management

### Appropriate AI Tasks
- **Well-Defined Components**: Delegate specific, clearly defined tasks to AI[9]
- **Implementation Details**: Use AI for detailed implementation after architectural decisions[9]
- **Code Generation**: Generate boilerplate and repetitive code patterns[6][9]
- **Refactoring**: Assist with code refactoring and optimization[6][9]

### Human-Retained Responsibilities
- **Architecture Design**: Complex interactions and software architecture remain human domain[9]
- **Strategic Decisions**: Long-term planning and strategic thinking[9]
- **Domain Knowledge**: Business logic and domain-specific decisions[9]
- **Final Approval**: All architectural and design decisions[9]

## Quality Control and Testing

### Code Understanding Requirement
- **Line-by-Line Review**: Must understand every single line of AI-generated code[12]
- **Logic Verification**: Verify the logic and approach of all generated code[12]
- **Integration Review**: Ensure code integrates properly with existing codebase[12]
- **Security Assessment**: Review code for security implications[12]

### Testing Requirements
- **Immediate Testing**: Test all AI-generated code immediately after generation[12]
- **Build Validation**: Ensure code builds successfully before proceeding[9]
- **Functionality Testing**: Verify that code works as intended[12]
- **Edge Case Testing**: Test for edge cases and error conditions[9]

### Iterative Improvement
- **Test-Driven Development**: Let AI use TDD approach with autonomous testing[9]
- **Automated Feedback**: Allow AI to run build and test commands for self-correction[9]
- **Iterative Refinement**: Refine code based on test results and feedback[6][9]
- **Continuous Learning**: Learn from mistakes and improve future interactions[9]

## Error Handling and Problem Resolution

### Systematic Error Resolution
- **One Error at a Time**: Address build errors systematically, individually
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Search for existing solutions before implementing fixes
- **Documentation**: Track what has been resolved and what remains
- **Progressive Resolution**: Move to next error only after current one is resolved

### Problem Analysis Workflow
- **Error Identification**: Clearly identify and categorize the error
- **Solution Research**: Search for existing solutions and best practices
- **Implementation Planning**: Plan the fix before implementing
- **Verification**: Verify the fix resolves the issue without creating new ones

## Performance and Optimization Guidelines

### Modern Standards Only
- **Latest Practices**: Follow current best practices and avoid deprecated methods[40][43]
- **Performance First**: Prioritize performance in all AI-generated solutions[4][5]
- **Type Safety**: Ensure all AI-generated code uses proper TypeScript typing[40][43]
- **Security by Default**: Implement security considerations in all solutions[47]

### Code Quality Standards
- **Clean Code**: Generate clean, readable, and maintainable code[43]
- **Documentation**: Include appropriate comments and documentation[6]
- **Testing**: Include or suggest appropriate tests for generated code[9][44]
- **Best Practices**: Follow established best practices for the technology stack[1][2]

## Collaboration and Learning

### Knowledge Sharing
- **Explain Decisions**: Always explain the reasoning behind suggested solutions[6]
- **Alternative Approaches**: Suggest and explain different approaches when applicable[6]
- **Learning Opportunities**: Use interactions as opportunities for knowledge transfer[42][45]
- **Best Practices**: Share relevant best practices and optimization techniques[6]

### Continuous Improvement
- **Feedback Integration**: Incorporate human feedback into future suggestions[6][9]
- **Skill Development**: Help improve human understanding of code and patterns[6]
- **Process Refinement**: Continuously improve the collaboration process[6][45]
- **Quality Enhancement**: Strive for higher quality outputs over time[6][9]
