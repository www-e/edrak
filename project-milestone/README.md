# Edrak Project Milestones

This directory contains the detailed task breakdown and implementation plan for the Edrak educational platform.

## Structure

- `frontend/` - Frontend implementation tasks and requirements
- `backend/` - Backend implementation tasks and requirements
- `database/` - Database schema and migration tasks
- `integrations/` - Third-party service integration tasks (Paymob, Bunny CDN)

## Implementation Approach

We'll follow the APCE methodology:

1. **Analyze** - Understand requirements thoroughly
2. **Plan** - Create detailed implementation plan
3. **Confirm** - Get approval before implementation
4. **Execute** - Implement with clean, minimal code

Each feature will be implemented as a separate milestone with clear deliverables.
