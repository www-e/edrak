- Performance optimization guidelines

## Technology Stack

### Frontend

- Next.js 15.5.2 with App Router
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS v4 for styling
- shadcn/ui components
- React Hook Form
- React Query

### Backend

## Implementation Approach

### Clean Code Principles

- No dead code or unused features
- Minimal implementation per requirement
- Single responsibility per file/component
- Clear separation of concerns

### Development Methodology

- APCE approach (Analyze, Plan, Confirm, Execute)
- Feature-based architecture
- Type-safe development
- Comprehensive testing strategy

### Quality Assurance

- Code reviews for all changes
- Automated testing requirements
- Security best practices
- Performance optimization

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions

1. Run `npm run env:setup` to create .env file
2. Configure database and service accounts
3. Run `npm run db:init` to initialize database
4. Begin implementing authentication system

### Short-term Goals

1. Complete Milestone 1 (Database Schema)
2. Implement Milestone 2 (Authentication System)
3. Set up Milestone 3 (tRPC API Layer)
4. Begin integration implementations

## Verification

All requirements have been verified and documented in:

- REQUIREMENTS_VERIFICATION.md
- TASK_TRACKING.md
- PROJECT_PLAN.md

We have successfully translated your detailed requirements into a comprehensive implementation plan that adheres to your standards of clean, minimal code without any unnecessary features.
