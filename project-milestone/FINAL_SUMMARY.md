# Edrak Project - Final Implementation Summary

## Project Overview

We have successfully analyzed and planned the implementation of the Edrak educational platform, a comprehensive learning management system with three distinct user roles: Admin, Professor, and Student.

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Database Schema (Completed)

- Designed complete Prisma schema with all required models
- Established proper relationships between entities
- Defined enums for role-based access control
- Included support for courses, lessons, enrollments, payments, and file attachments

### 2. Authentication System (Planned)

- Role-based authentication with separate sign-in paths
- Session management with NextAuth.js
- Password security with bcryptjs
- Role-based UI guards

### 3. API Layer (Planned)

- Type-safe tRPC implementation
- Comprehensive procedures for all features
- Input validation with Zod
- Role-based access control

### 4. Payment Integration (Planned)

- Paymob integration for credit card and mobile wallet payments
- Support for iframe (credit card) and intention (mobile wallets)
- Payment callback handling
- Coupon system integration

### 5. File Management (Planned)

- Bunny CDN integration for file storage
- Secure file upload and download
- Attachment management for lessons

### 6. Frontend Dashboards (Planned)

- Admin dashboard with full system management
- Professor dashboard for course creation
- Student dashboard for learning
- Public catalog for anonymous users

## Key Features by Role

### Admin (Owner/Operator)

- User management (create/read/update/deactivate all roles)
- Password management and role assignment
- Course management (create/update, assign to professors)
- Lesson management (create/update, soft delete/restore)
- Attachment management (upload/remove)
- Commerce management (coupons, payment reconciliation)

### Professor (Content Owner/Face)

- View assigned courses
- Manage lessons for assigned courses
- Upload/remove attachments
- View enrollment statistics

### Student (Learner)

- Browse course catalog
- Enroll in courses via Paymob
- Access enrolled courses
- Track lesson completion
- Download attachments

### Anonymous/Guest

- View catalog and course pages
- Attempt checkout (redirects to sign-in/sign-up)

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend

- Next.js 15.5.2 with App Router
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS v4 for styling
- shadcn/ui components with Radix UI primitives
- React Hook Form for form handling
- React Query for data fetching

### Backend

- tRPC for type-safe API communication
- Prisma ORM for database management
- PostgreSQL as the database
- NextAuth.js for authentication
- Zod for input validation

### Integrations

- Paymob for payment processing
- Bunny CDN for file storage
- JSON Web Tokens for session management

## Implementation Approach

We're following the APCE methodology:

1. **Analyze** - Thoroughly understand requirements
2. **Plan** - Create detailed implementation plan
3. **Confirm** - Get approval before implementation
4. **Execute** - Implement with clean, minimal code

## Our Commitment

1. **100% Clean Code**: No dead code or unused features
2. **Minimal Implementation**: Only what's required
3. **Proper Separation**: Clear distinction between frontend and backend
4. **Role-Based Access**: Secure access control for all features
5. **Performance Focused**: Optimized for speed and efficiency

## Next Steps

1. Confirm the database schema design
2. Proceed with implementing the authentication system
3. Build the tRPC API layer
4. Implement Paymob and Bunny CDN integrations
5. Create the frontend dashboards

This approach ensures we build exactly what you need without any extra features or complexity, following all the rules and guidelines you've specified.
