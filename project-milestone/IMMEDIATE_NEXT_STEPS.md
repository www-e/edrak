# Edrak Project - Immediate Next Steps

## Overview

This document outlines the immediate actions to begin implementing the Edrak educational platform based on our comprehensive plan.

## Current Status

- ✅ Requirements analysis complete
- ✅ Database schema designed and implemented
- ✅ Project structure and milestones defined
- ✅ Environment setup documented
- ✅ Implementation plan verified

## Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Environment Setup (Day 1)

1. Create `.env` file with required environment variables
2. Set up PostgreSQL database locally
3. Configure Paymob account (sandbox for development)
4. Configure Bunny CDN account (sandbox for development)
5. Install project dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### 2. Database Initialization (Day 1)

1. Generate Prisma client:
   ```bash
   npx prisma generate
   ```
2. Run initial database migration:
   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate dev --name init
   ```
3. Verify database schema in Prisma Studio:
   ```bash
   npx prisma studio
   ```

### 3. Authentication System Implementation (Days 2-4)

1. Configure NextAuth.js with credentials provider
2. Implement user registration API endpoint
3. Implement user login API endpoint
4. Add password hashing with bcryptjs
5. Create role-based access control middleware
6. Implement password reset functionality
7. Add session management
8. Test authentication flows

### 4. tRPC API Layer Setup (Days 5-6)

1. Configure tRPC with Next.js App Router
2. Set up context with user session
3. Implement error handling
4. Add input validation with Zod
5. Create basic user management procedures
6. Test API endpoints

### 5. Development Environment Verification (Day 7)

1. Run development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
2. Verify authentication flows
3. Test API endpoints
4. Confirm database operations
5. Validate environment configuration

## Milestone 1 Completion Checklist

### Database Schema (Completed)

- [x] Prisma schema file created
- [x] All models defined
- [x] Relationships established
- [x] Enums created
- [ ] Database migrations run
- [ ] Seed data created (optional for now)

## Resources Needed

### Accounts to Set Up

1. Paymob sandbox account
2. Bunny CDN account
3. PostgreSQL database (local or cloud)

### Development Tools

1. Node.js v16+
2. PostgreSQL
3. VS Code with recommended extensions
4. Postman for API testing

## Timeline

### Week 1

- Environment setup
- Database initialization
- Authentication system implementation

### Week 2

- tRPC API layer
- Basic API procedures
- Development environment verification

### Week 3

- Begin Paymob integration
- Begin Bunny CDN integration
- Start Admin dashboard implementation

## Success Criteria for Immediate Phase

1. ✅ Development environment fully configured
2. ✅ Database schema implemented and migrated
3. ✅ Basic authentication working
4. ✅ tRPC API layer functional
5. ✅ Development server running without errors

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Issues

1. **Database Connection Issues**

   - Solution: Verify DATABASE_URL in .env file
   - Solution: Check PostgreSQL service status

2. **Authentication Configuration Problems**

   - Solution: Verify NEXTAUTH_SECRET and NEXTAUTH_URL
   - Solution: Check callback URLs in NextAuth configuration

3. **Prisma Schema Issues**
   - Solution: Run `npx prisma validate` to check schema
   - Solution: Review relationships and constraints

### Contingency Plans

1. If Paymob integration is delayed, implement mock payment system
2. If Bunny CDN setup is complex, use local file storage temporarily
3. If PostgreSQL is problematic, consider alternative databases supported by Prisma

## Verification Process

### Daily Checks

1. Code compiles without errors
2. Development server runs
3. Database operations work
4. Authentication flows function

### End of Week Review

1. Complete functionality verification
2. Code quality assessment
3. Performance evaluation
4. Security review

## Communication Plan

### Daily Standups

- Quick sync on progress
- Identify blockers
- Plan next steps

### Weekly Reviews

- Comprehensive progress assessment
- Milestone completion verification
- Plan adjustments as needed

This roadmap provides a clear path to begin implementation while ensuring we maintain the clean, minimal code approach you've requested.
