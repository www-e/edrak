# Edrak Development Workflow

## Overview

This document outlines the development workflow and coding standards for the Edrak project, ensuring consistent, high-quality code delivery.

## Development Process

### 1. Feature Implementation Cycle

1. **Analyze**: Understand the feature requirements and technical implications
2. **Plan**: Create implementation plan with file modifications and reasoning
3. **Confirm**: Get approval before proceeding with implementation
4. **Execute**: Implement with clean, minimal code following project standards

### 2. Branching Strategy

- `main` branch for production-ready code
- Feature branches for each milestone/feature
- Release branches for versioned releases
- Hotfix branches for urgent production fixes

### 3. Pull Request Process

1. Create PR with clear description of changes
2. Ensure all tests pass
3. Request code review from team members
4. Address feedback and make necessary changes
5. Merge after approval

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- Use strict mode with noImplicitAny
- Define explicit return types for all functions
- Use interfaces for object shapes
- Leverage generics for reusable components
- Avoid `any` type - use `unknown` instead

### React

- Use functional components with hooks
- Implement proper useEffect dependencies
- Use memoization where appropriate (React.memo, useMemo, useCallback)
- Follow single responsibility principle for components
- Keep components under 250 lines

### File Organization

- Use feature-based architecture
- Separate presentational and container components
- Co-locate related files (components, tests, styles)
- Use descriptive file names with kebab-case

### Naming Conventions

- Components: PascalCase (`UserProfile.tsx`)
- Variables/Functions: camelCase (`getUserById`)
- Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (`MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS`)
- Interfaces: PascalCase with I prefix (`IUser`)
- Types: PascalCase (`UserRole`)

## Code Quality

### Linting

- ESLint with Next.js recommended rules
- Prettier for code formatting
- Commit hooks for code quality enforcement

### Testing

- Unit tests for all components and functions
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- End-to-end tests for critical user flows
- Test coverage target: 80%+

### Documentation

- JSDoc comments for complex functions
- README updates for new features
- Inline comments for non-obvious code

## Performance Optimization

### Frontend

- Code splitting with dynamic imports
- Image optimization with Next.js Image component
- Lazy loading for components below the fold
- Memoization for expensive computations

### Backend

- Database query optimization
- Proper indexing
- Caching strategies
- Efficient API responses

## Security Practices

### Authentication

- Secure password hashing with bcryptjs
- JWT for session management
- Role-based access control
- Rate limiting for auth endpoints

### Data Protection

- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention with Prisma
- XSS prevention with proper escaping
- CSRF protection

### Secure Coding

- Environment variables for secrets
- HTTPS enforcement in production
- Security headers configuration
- Regular dependency updates

## Deployment Process

### Continuous Integration

1. Code pushed to feature branch
2. Automated tests run on CI server
3. Code quality checks performed
4. Build verification

### Continuous Deployment

1. Pull request merged to main branch
2. Automated build process
3. Automated deployment to staging
4. Manual verification
5. Production deployment

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Error Tracking

- Sentry integration for error monitoring
- Performance monitoring
- Alerting for critical issues

### Logging

- Structured logging
- Log levels (debug, info, warn, error)
- Log retention policies

### Performance Monitoring

- Page load time tracking
- API response time monitoring
- Database query performance

## Tools and Extensions

### Recommended VS Code Extensions

- TypeScript Importer
- ESLint
- Prettier
- Tailwind CSS IntelliSense
- Prisma

### Development Tools

- Postman for API testing
- Prisma Studio for database browsing
- React DevTools for component debugging
- Lighthouse for performance auditing

## Review Process

### Code Reviews

- Every pull request must be reviewed
- Check for security vulnerabilities
- Verify performance implications
- Ensure code quality standards
- Confirm requirements are met

### Quality Gates

- All tests must pass
- Code coverage requirements met
- Security scans completed
- Performance benchmarks maintained

This workflow ensures consistent, high-quality development while maintaining the clean, minimal code approach you've requested.
