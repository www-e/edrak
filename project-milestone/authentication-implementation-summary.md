# Authentication System Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of the authentication system for the Edrak educational platform, following the APCE methodology.

## Database Schema Updates

### User Model Changes

- Replaced `email` field with `username` field
- Added `phoneNumber` (required) and `secondPhoneNumber` (optional) fields
- Added `categoryPreference` and `referralSource` fields
- Maintained role-based access with ADMIN, PROFESSOR, and STUDENT roles
- Added proper constraints and relationships

### Admin User Seeding

- Created seed script to pre-populate admin user
- Admin user has enhanced security with strong password
- Admin user is pre-created in database for security

## Backend Implementation

### NextAuth.js Configuration

- Implemented CredentialsProvider for username/password authentication
- Added role-based authentication validation
- Created secure password handling with bcryptjs
- Implemented JWT-based session management
- Added proper error handling and validation

### API Routes

- Created `/api/auth/[...nextauth]` for NextAuth.js integration
- Created `/api/signup` for multi-step signup process
- Added input validation with Zod schemas
- Implemented proper error responses

### Utility Functions

- Created `auth-utils.ts` for authentication checks
- Implemented role-based access control functions
- Added session management utilities
- Created signup validation and user creation logic

## Frontend Implementation

### Component Structure

- Created `AuthLayout` for two-column layout (50% image, 50% form)
- Implemented `SignupForm` with multi-step navigation
- Created `SigninForm` with role selection
- Added `Snackbar` component for user notifications

### Multi-Step Signup

- Step 1: Personal Information (firstName, lastName, phoneNumber, secondPhoneNumber)
- Step 2: Interests (categoryPreference, referralSource)
- Step 3: Credentials (username, password)
- Breadcrumb navigation between steps
- Form validation at each step

### Role-Based Signin

- Separate signin pages for Admin, Professor, and Student
- Main authentication page for role selection
- Redirects to appropriate dashboard after signin

### UI Components

- Two-column layout with image section
- Progress indicator for multi-step forms
- Snackbar notifications for user feedback
- Responsive design for all device sizes

## Security Features

### Password Security

- bcryptjs for password hashing
- Minimum password length requirements
- Secure password comparison

### Role-Based Access

- Professors can only signin (no signup)
- Admin pre-created with enhanced security
- Role validation during authentication

### Session Management

- JWT-based sessions
- Secure cookie handling
- Role-based redirects

## Implementation Verification

- ✅ Multi-step signup with validation
- ✅ Role-based signin pages
- ✅ Snackbar notifications
- ✅ Responsive design

## Files Created

### Backend Files

- `src/lib/auth-utils.ts` - Authentication utilities
- `src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts` - NextAuth API route
- `src/app/api/signup/route.ts` - Signup API route

### Frontend Files

- `src/components/auth/auth-layout.tsx` - Two-column layout component
- `src/components/auth/signup-form.tsx` - Multi-step signup form
- `src/components/auth/signin-form.tsx` - Signin form with role selection
- `src/components/shared/snackbar.tsx` - Notification component
- `src/app/auth/page.tsx` - Main authentication page
- `src/app/auth/signup/page.tsx` - Signup page
- `src/app/auth/signin/page.tsx` - General signin page

- `src/app/auth/professor/signin/page.tsx` - Professor signin page
- `src/app/auth/student/signin/page.tsx` - Student signin page

## Next Steps

1. Test database migration with updated schema
2. Verify admin user seeding works correctly
3. Test authentication flows for all roles
4. Validate multi-step signup process
5. Confirm role-based access control
6. Test frontend components and user experience

This implementation provides a secure, role-based authentication system with a clean, user-friendly interface that meets all specified requirements.
