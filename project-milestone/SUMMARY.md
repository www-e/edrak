# Edrak Project - Implementation Summary

## Project Overview

Based on your detailed requirements, we're building a comprehensive educational platform with three distinct user roles:

1. **Admin** - Full system management
2. **Professor** - Course content creation and management
3. **Student** - Course enrollment and learning

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Database Schema

- Complete Prisma schema with all required models
- Proper relationships between entities
- Role-based access control foundation
- Support for courses, lessons, enrollments, payments, and file attachments

### 2. Authentication System

- Role-based authentication with separate sign-in paths
- Session management with NextAuth.js
- Password security with bcryptjs
- Role-based UI guards

### 3. API Layer

- Type-safe tRPC implementation
- Comprehensive procedures for all features
- Input validation with Zod
- Role-based access control

### 4. Payment Integration

- Paymob integration for credit card and mobile wallet payments
- Support for iframe (credit card) and intention (mobile wallets)
- Payment callback handling
- Coupon system integration

### 5. File Management

- Bunny CDN integration for file storage
- Secure file upload and download
- Attachment management for lessons

### 6. Frontend Dashboards

- Admin dashboard with full system management
- Professor dashboard for course creation
- Student dashboard for learning
- Public catalog for anonymous users

## Implementation Approach

We're following the APCE methodology:

1. **Analyze** - Thoroughly understand requirements
2. **Plan** - Create detailed implementation plan
3. **Confirm** - Get approval before implementation
4. **Execute** - Implement with clean, minimal code

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15.5.2, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- **Backend**: tRPC, Prisma ORM, NextAuth.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Payments**: Paymob
- **File Storage**: Bunny CDN

## Next Steps

1. Confirm the database schema design
2. Proceed with implementing the authentication system
3. Build the tRPC API layer
4. Implement Paymob and Bunny CDN integrations
5. Create the frontend dashboards

## Our Commitment

- **100% clean code** - No dead code or unused features
- **Minimal implementation** - Only what's required
- **Proper separation** - Clear distinction between frontend and backend
- **Role-based access** - Secure access control for all features
- **Performance focused** - Optimized for speed and efficiency

This approach ensures we build exactly what you need without any extra features or complexity.
