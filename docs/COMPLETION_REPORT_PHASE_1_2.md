# Project Refinement & Stabilization Report (Phases 1 & 2) - ARCHIVED

**NOTE**: This report has been superseded by `COMPLETION_REPORT_PHASE_3.md` which includes the current status of the project.

## 1. Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive summary of the work completed to stabilize the Edrak Admin Panel codebase, resolve all build-blocking errors, eliminate technical debt, and establish a production-ready foundation for future feature development.

The project has been successfully transitioned from a partially-functional state with mock data to a stable, fully type-safe, and data-driven application connected to a live backend.

## 2. Phase 1: Critical Error Resolution

This phase focused on fixing all 10 build-blocking TypeScript and ESLint errors.

| ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/src/services/auth-service.ts`                 | Removed `showSnackbar` calls and misleading `isAuthenticated`/`getCurrentUserRole` methods. Refactored to throw errors for the UI to handle.         | Service modules cannot use React hooks. Placeholders were a security risk.                              |
| `/src/components/auth/signin-form.tsx`          | Implemented `try...catch` blocks to handle errors from `AuthService` and display user feedback via the `useSnackbar` hook.                          | Moved UI feedback logic from the service layer to the presentation layer, where it belongs.             |
| `/src/components/auth/signup-form.tsx`          | Implemented `try...catch` blocks to handle errors from `AuthService` and display user feedback via the `useSnackbar` hook.                          | Moved UI feedback logic from the service layer to the presentation layer.                               |
| `/src/app/api/upload/route.ts`                  | Replaced Pages Router `getServerAuthSession` pattern with the correct App Router pattern (`getServerSession(authOptions)`). Removed all `any` types. | Resolved critical type-safety violations and aligned the API route with Next.js 13+ best practices. |
| `/src/components/admin/media/attachment-list.tsx` | Removed invalid `alt` props from all `<File>`, `<Image>`, `<Video>`, and `<FileText>` icon components.                                              | `lucide-react` components are SVGs and do not accept the `alt` prop, which is for `<img>` tags.           |

**Outcome:** The project is now 100% free of build errors and type warnings, establishing a stable baseline.

## 3. Phase 2: Code Health and Consistency

This phase focused on eliminating mock data and standardizing coding patterns across the admin panel.

| File Path                      | Changes Made                                                                                                                                  | Reason                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/src/app/admin/page.tsx`      | Removed all hardcoded metric and user data. Implemented `api.admin.commerce.getDashboardMetrics` and `api.admin.user.getAll` tRPC queries.      | Adhered to the "No Mock Data" rule. The dashboard now displays live, real-time data from the database.                     |
| `/src/app/admin/courses/page.tsx`| Replaced the `mockCourses` array with a live `api.admin.course.getAll` tRPC query. Implemented robust, null-safe sorting and type-guarded rendering. | Connected the course list to the live backend and ensured full type-safety for the generic `DataTable` component.             |
| `/src/app/admin/users/new/page.tsx`| Refactored the entire form from manual `useState` to use `react-hook-form` and `zodResolver`.                                                    | Standardized form handling to match project best practices, reducing boilerplate and improving validation reliability. |

**Outcome:** The admin panel is now fully data-driven, free of mock data, and follows consistent, modern patterns for form management.

## 4. Backend Foundation Enhancement (Phase 1 Prerequisite)

To support the frontend refactoring, the backend tRPC API was significantly expanded.

| File Path                                      | Changes Made                                                                                              | Reason                                                                                                 |
| ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `/src/server/services/userService.ts`          | Added `getUserById` method.                                                                                 | To provide data for the upcoming User Detail and Edit pages.                                             |
| `/src/server/api/routers/admin/user.ts`        | Exposed a `getById` procedure.                                                                              | To make the `getUserById` service accessible to the frontend.                                          |
| `/src/server/services/courseService.ts`        | Added `getAllCourses`, `getCourseById`, and `updateCourse` methods.                                           | To enable listing, viewing, and editing of courses.                                                      |
| `/src/server/api/routers/admin/course.ts`      | Exposed `getAll`, `getById`, and `update` procedures.                                                       | To make the new course services accessible to the frontend.                                            |
| `/src/server/services/commerceService.ts`      | Added `getDashboardMetrics`, `getAllCoupons`, and `getCouponById` methods.                                  | To provide data for the main dashboard and the future Commerce section.                                |
| `/src/server/api/routers/admin/commerce.ts`   | Exposed `getDashboardMetrics`, `getAllCoupons`, and `getCouponById` procedures.                             | To make the new commerce services accessible to the frontend.                                          |

**Outcome:** The tRPC backend is now robust and complete enough to support the full feature set outlined in the project's architectural documents.
