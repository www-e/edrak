3. **Modern Interface**: Clean, professional design with clear information hierarchy
4. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with touch-friendly interactions

### Technical Requirements
1. **shadcn/ui Integration**: Use existing components with sportschool theme
2. **No Hardcoded Colors**: All styling through CSS variables from globals.css
3. **No Dead Code**: Every component justified by backend APIs
4. **Type Safety**: Strict TypeScript typing for all components
5. **Performance**: Optimized data loading and rendering

### Component Architecture
1. **Feature-Based Organization**: Components organized by admin features
2. **Shared Components**: Reusable elements in shared directories
3. **Layout Components**: Consistent admin layout with header/sidebar
4. **Page Components**: Dedicated pages for all operations (no modals)

## Styling Guidelines

### Color Palette Usage
All components use CSS variables from globals.css:
- `--background` / `--foreground` for main colors
- `--primary` / `--primary-foreground` for primary actions
- `--secondary` / `--secondary-foreground` for secondary actions
- `--muted` / `--muted-foreground` for subtle elements
- `--accent` / `--accent-foreground` for highlights
- `--destructive` for danger actions
- `--border` for borders
- `--ring` for focus states

### Component Patterns
- Use `cn()` utility for class merging
- Follow shadcn/ui component structure
- Use Tailwind classes exclusively
- Implement dark mode support with `.dark` class

### Typography
Use existing heading classes from globals.css:
- `.heading-1` for main titles
- `.heading-2` for section titles
- `.body-normal` for regular content

## LMS Course Structure Implementation

### Course Organization
1. **Course** - Top-level container with:
   - Title, description, price
   - Language, visibility status
   - Professor assignment
   - Category association

2. **Lesson** - Content units within courses with:
   - Title, content (rich text)
   - Order/sequence number
   - Video URL (optional)
   - Visibility status
   - Soft delete capability

3. **Attachments** - File resources linked to lessons:
   - File resources linked to lessons
   - Downloadable materials
   - External resource links

## Quality Assurance

### Code Standards
- Follow existing component patterns in the codebase
- Use TypeScript for all components with proper typing
