- `admin.user.create` - Create new user
- `admin.user.update` - Update existing user
- `admin.user.resetPassword` - Reset user password

### Course Management APIs ✅
- `admin.course.getAll` - List all courses
- `admin.course.getById` - Get specific course details
- `admin.course.createCourse` - Create new course
- `admin.course.update` - Update existing course
- `admin.course.createLesson` - Create new lesson
- `admin.course.getLesson` - Get specific lesson details
- `admin.course.getLessonAttachments` - Get lesson attachments

## Key Issues Identified

### 1. Incomplete CRUD Operations
While the backend APIs are largely complete, the frontend pages for full CRUD operations are missing:
- Course management is missing detail and edit pages
- Lesson management is missing listing and edit pages
- Commerce management pages are largely incomplete

### 2. Navigation Structure Gaps
- Missing proper breadcrumb navigation for nested pages
- Incomplete sidebar navigation structure
- Missing links to planned pages

### 3. Feature Completeness
- Payment and coupon management pages are almost entirely missing
- Lesson management is incomplete

## Progress Since Phase 1 & 2 Completion

### ✅ Major Improvements
1. **Build Error Resolution**: All 10 build-blocking TypeScript and ESLint errors have been resolved
2. **Mock Data Elimination**: Admin dashboard now uses live backend data instead of mock data
3. **Form Standardization**: User creation form now uses react-hook-form and zod validation
4. **Backend API Expansion**: tRPC backend has been significantly expanded to support full feature set
5. **Type Safety**: Implementation now follows consistent, modern patterns for type safety
6. **Media Management**: Added components for file upload and attachment management
7. **User Management Completion**: Fully implemented user CRUD operations

### ✅ Technical Debt Reduction
1. **Service Layer Cleanup**: Removed misleading methods from AuthService
2. **UI Feedback Logic**: Moved UI feedback logic from service layer to presentation layer
3. **App Router Alignment**: Fixed API routes to use correct App Router patterns
4. **Accessibility Fixes**: Removed invalid props from icon components

## Priority Recommendations

### Phase 1: Critical Missing Pages
1. Course Detail Page (`/admin/courses/[id]`)
2. Course Edit Page (`/admin/courses/[id]/edit`)
3. Lesson Listing Page (`/admin/courses/[id]/lessons`)
4. Lesson Edit Page (`/admin/courses/[id]/lessons/[lessonId]/edit`)

### Phase 2: Commerce Dashboard
1. Payment listing page
2. Complete coupon management pages
3. Financial reporting features

### Phase 3: Polish & Enhancement
1. Proper breadcrumb navigation
2. Complete sidebar navigation
3. Data loading states and error handling
4. Mobile responsiveness improvements

## Conclusion

The Edrak admin dashboard has made significant progress following the completion of Phases 1 & 2. The foundation is now stable, build errors have been eliminated, and the dashboard is fully data-driven with live backend integration.

Approximately 60-70% of the planned functionality is now implemented, with user management completely finished and other areas partially complete. The backend APIs are fully prepared for implementing the remaining frontend pages.

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Implement missing course and lesson management pages
2. **Short-term**: Develop commerce management pages and features
3. **Medium-term**: Add proper navigation and breadcrumb structures
4. **Long-term**: Polish UI/UX and add advanced features
